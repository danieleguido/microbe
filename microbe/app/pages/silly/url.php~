There was one who was famed for the number of things<br/>
 He forgot when he entered the ship:<br/>
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,<br/>
 And the clothes he had bought for the trip.<br/>
<br/>
He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,<br/>
 With his name painted clearly on each:<br/>
But, since he omitted to mention the fact,<br/>
 They were all left behind on the beach.<br/>
<br/>
The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because<br/>
 He had seven coats on when he came,<br/>
With three pairs of bootsâ€”but the worst of it was,<br/>
 He had wholly forgotten his name.<br/>
