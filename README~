 ° welcome to microbe, the lightest-weight pseudo mwc made with php.
 Basically, it handle url redirection, class autoloader and a soft view architecture.
 The model-controller part of the cake, is on the run.
 Note: the 0.0.0 version does not handle controllers, views, models and layouts...
 Use at your own risks!

 ° how to SETUP microbe
 firstly, grab the code. Then put carefully on line, uploading 
 the files somewhere in your server.
 The basic structure of your mymicrobe.com/labs is:
 
 [] labs/
    + index.php
    [] microbe/

 of course both "labs" or "mymicrobe" here are for demo
 purpose, so you're free to use your own names.
 We will use the symbol %/ to represent microbe root directory.

°  °
 ° first run microbe
 This below is my microbe config under apache2. Basically it's a 404 redirect,
 with a dummy alias. of course you can use the 303 redirect, or .htaccess.
 Cfr. the labs/microbe/bootstrap.php file for more info.
 However, every "not found" page should be handled by %/index.php,
 the file which will contain your favourite (and lonely) layout
 
  Alias /microbe /home/.../public/microbe
  <Directory /home/.../public/microbe>
        ErrorDocument 404 /labs/index.php
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
  </Directory>

 The core of microbe is the bootstrap.php.
 In opur sample, there is an php "include ...bootstrap.php" at the very
 beginning of %/index.php file.
 point your browser at <mymicrobe.com/microbe>. you shoudl see a nice index.php
 welcome page. of course, if you changed the /microbe in your apache settings,
 or you would like to have right in your server root, you have
 to configure your microbe installation properly: the css won't work
 without configuration! See below.

°   °
 ° configure!
 The %microbe/configs.php file contains the basic defined const.
 Yous hould change the values according to your project.

 # URL related const. To be modified, as you like.
  define( "THE_URL", "/microbe" );
  define( "THE_MICROBE_URL", THE_URL ."/microbe" );
  define( "STATIC_URL", THE_MICROBE_URL ."/static" );
  define( "THE_MICROBE_DEFAULT_PAGE", "default/index" );
  define( "THE_MICROBE_404_PAGE", "404" );

°    °
 ° test the router
 point your browser at <mymicrobe.com/microbe/silly/url>
 You should see a wonderful picture and a bunch of verses.
